<p><strong>Sticker chat guide:</strong></p>
<p>#sticker-chat is a channel in the server where, as you may have guessed, you can only send Discord stickers!</p>
<p>In this channel, you can spam stickers for as long as you like!</p>
<p>But if you try to send anything besides a sticker, Jack's Bot will automatically delete your message!</p>
