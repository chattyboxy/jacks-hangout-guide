<p><strong>Contribution Guide:</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for offering to help with collaborating on this guide!</p>
<p>If you want to write a tutorial on something you can do in my server (such as using a function of Jack's Bot, a specific game channel, etc...), then this is how you do it!</p>
<p>Every guide page you submit will earn you 4,000 Jack's Bot coins in my Discord Server!</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p>Check that there isn't already a published guide on the topic! Visit <a href="https://guide.jackgames.net">https://guide.jackgames.net</a> and look at the list of topics.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p>
<p>Go to <a href="https://github.com/login">https://github.com/login</a> and either sign in or make an account!</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong></p>
<p>Once you are signed in, visit <a href="https://github.com/chattyboxy/jacks-hangout-guide">https://github.com/chattyboxy/jacks-hangout-guide</a> .</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong></p>
<p>Near the top right, click the "Fork" button. This will open a new page. You are creating a copy of the site, which you will make your edits on before merging it back in with my published site, all done via GitHub.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong></p>
<p>On this page, under "Repository Name", call it "(guide name) page". For example, if I was writing a guide on moneychat, I would call it "moneychat page".</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong></p>
<p>Make sure to leave "Copy the&nbsp;<em>main</em> branch only" selected. Then click "Create fork".</p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong></p>
<p>You are now ready to create your guide page! Visit the website <a href="https://html-online.com/editor/">https://html-online.com/editor/</a> in a new tab.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong></p>
<p>On that website, use the tools on the left-hand side to create a guide page for your chosen topic. Make it descriptive and easy to follow for a new user! You can lay this out however you like (the guide is community-contributed, so doesn't need to look identical on each different page). You may also want to credit yourself at the bottom of the page - this is optional.</p>
<p><strong>Step 9:</strong></p>
<p>On the right-hand side of the website, select all of the HTML code it has generated, and copy it to your clipboard. Don't close the HTML generator, as you may need it if you accidentally clear your clipboard!</p>
<p><strong>Step 10:</strong></p>
<p>Return to the GitHub Fork that you made. Click "Add file" (to the left of the green button). Click "Create new file".</p>
<p><strong>Step 11:</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Important:<span style="color: #000000;"> Where it says "Name your file" in a box, you need to do the following. First of all, decide what your page will be called. This name is what will appear after the / in the <em>guide.jackgames.net<strong>/</strong></em> URL.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">Then, in the name box, type "<strong>pagename/index.html</strong>". It is important that you include the /index.html bit, as otherwise, it won't register as a new page.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">For example, if I was making a guide about the moneychat channel, I would call it "<strong>moneychat/index.html</strong>". It will automatically reformat this to include a new folder called "moneychat" with the file being called "index.html".</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">Step 12:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the text box below, paste in the full code you copied from the HTML generator. Scroll down, and make sure "Commit directly to the&nbsp;<em>main</em> branch is selected. Click the green "Commit new file" button.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">Step 13:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">On the page it takes you to, click the "Contribute" button (underneath the "Go to file" button). On the dropdown menu, click the green "Open pull request" button.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">Step 14:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">On the "Open a pull request" page that opens, where it wants you to give a title (it currently should say "Create index.html"), replace that with the title of the page you made. For example, "moneychat". In the "Leave a comment" section, write a brief description of what you have created.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the "Leave a comment" section, if you want to receive your 4,000 free Jack's Bot coins, make sure to include your Discord Username and # number, EG <em>JackGames#0322</em>, to make sure I can give you your coins!</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">Step 15:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">Make sure "Allow edits by maintainers" is ticked, and then click the green "Create pull request" button!</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">Step 16:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>You have now submitted your page contribution! I will have to manually review your contribution, and then I will "approve" the pull request, which will merge it into the live site at guide.jackgames.net .</p>
<p><strong>Step 17:</strong></p>
<p>If you want to preview how your new page looks on the site, take a look for a comment on your pull request by&nbsp;<strong>Netlify Bot</strong>. Within 20 seconds of you creating the request, it will show a comment with "Deploy preview for&nbsp;<em>jackshangoutguide</em> ready!". If it doesn't say this, keep refreshing the page until it has completed!</p>
<p>Once it has completed, you can click the unique URL next to "Deploy Preview" to look at your page!</p>
<p><strong>Step 18:</strong></p>
<p>You don't need to do anything else now! Just wait until I approve the pull request, and then it will automatically become part of the guide! You will receive an email (to the email you used to sign up to GitHub) once the pull request is approved!</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for contributing to the guide! Every successful guide contributed will earn you 4,000 Jack's Bot /coins (as long as you put your Discord username in the pull request "Leave a comment" section).</strong></p>
