<h2>Ticket Guide:</h2>
<p>Tickets are a way for you to get support from staff members!<br /><br /></p>
<p>To create a ticket go into #make-a-ticket and type anything you'd like</p>
<p>Jack or a SrMod+ will reply to your ticket asap!<br /><br /></p>
<p>Once your ticket has been closed, you will get a message from "Jack's Hangout Ticket Feedback"</p>
<p>You will be given a feedback link where you can fill in what you think of the support</p>
