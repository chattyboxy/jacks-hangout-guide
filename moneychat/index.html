<h2>Moneychat Guide:</h2>
<p>Moneychat is a channel in the Discord server where you have a chance to win coins once every half an hour!<br /><br /></p>
<p>Once every 30 minutes, the #money-chat channel will unlock (meaning everyone is given permission to talk in it). Then, the next person to talk in it will automatically be given a random amount of coins!</p>
<p>After someone has sent a message in it, it will lock again for the next 30 minutes, until it begins again!</p>
<p>If you want to get a ping every time it unlocks, just go to the #commands channel and type&nbsp;<strong>!moneychat</strong></p>
